## WORKING SETTINGS FILE
##
## This file contains settings for the compiled bous_therm model. It is read by
## a combination of functions in the bous_therm_io and bous_therm_settings
## source files. Unrecognized settings will cause an error. When running
## the model, the path to this or another settings file is the second
## command line input (first is grid directory, third is output directory).
## Not all physical parameters are defined here. Parameters less likely to
## change are preprocessor macros in the bous_therm_param.hpp header. If a
## setting that the model is expecting from this file goes undefined, it may
## cause weird behavior or errors. There are no default values compiled into
## the model for the settings in this file.
